		<h2>Step 1</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/cake_drawing1.jpg" class="process_image" alt = "Cake Drawing 1">
				</div>
				<p>
					In this piece, I used digital art. Before I even start thinking about colour, providing a sketch is crucial. Using the pastel pencil tool, I created a rough sketch
					of what I wanted to draw. It doesn't have to be perfect, just a general idea in terms of placement and what I want to include.
				</p>
			</div>

			<br>
			
		<h2>Step 2</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/cake_drawing2.jpg" class="process_image"  alt = "Cake Drawing 2">
				</div>
				<p>
					After completing a rough sketch and having a general idea of where the objects are placed, I make a more defined outline. This makes colouring a lot easier, since 
					I'll be able to have a fixed outline to guide me.
				</p>
			</div>
			<br>
		
		<h2>Step 3</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/cake_drawing3.jpg" class="process_image"  alt = "Cake Drawing 3">
				</div>
				<p>
					Now, we can start with the colouring process. Using the chalk tool, I begin to colour ontop in the outline (I wanted to remove the bold black outline). As I colour,
					I experiment with colours and add them to my palette. For this piece, I used a more pastel feel.
				</p>
			</div>
			
		<h2>Step 4</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/cake_drawing4.jpg" class="process_image"  alt = "Cake Drawing 4">
				</div>
				<p>
					Now that I've completed the base colours, I add more variety in colour, especially for the strawberries, milk carton, and face. This is usually quite time consuming, since
					I am adding some more detail as well. For instance, using the blur feature on the strawberries to give it a blended look.
				</p>
			</div>
		<h2>Step 5</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/cake_drawingfinal.png" class="process_image"  alt = "Cake Drawing Final">
				</div>
				<p>
					After completing all the colour, here comes my favourite part: highlights. This process is quick, but gives your art immediately a lot more pop and dimension. And here's
					the final piece!
				</p>
