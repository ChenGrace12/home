		<h1>My Music</h1>
			<p>Art can sometimes get awfully boring and tiring if you're sitting down for hours continuously. Music is a way to reduce stress and anxiety, and also makes art
			at lot more fun! Here are some of my favourite songs and artists that I recommend listening to.
			</p>

			<h2>Imase</h2>

				<h3>Genre: J-Pop</h3>
					<p>
						Imase has been rapidly climbing up the music charts, especially with his hit song, "NIGHT DANCER". Despite being a 21 year old self-taught
						artist, he is extremely talented, only learning how to create music in just one year. I generally like songs that have a quick beat rather 
						than calmer lofi songs, and I think Imase demonstrates that type of music perfectly.

			<h2>TWICE</h2>

				<h3>Genre: K-pop</h3>
					<p>
						TWICE has been my favourite music group for the past five years, and I've collected many of their albums and posters. Consisting of nine
						members, each member brings a unique voice and element to the table. They have several hit songs, such as "TT" and "What is Love?" that 
						also helped them achieve SOTY (Song of The Year) award three years in a row and also making them million-album sellers. TWICE's songs all are upbeat and a nice groove to them, and I
						totally recommend listening to them when you have the chance. "Sandcastle" is my favourite - I can listen to that song for the rest of my life
						and I'll still enjoy it.
					</p>
			<h2>Mario Kart Theme Songs</h2>

				<h3>Genre: Video Game Music</h3>
					<p>
						Having Mario Kart here seems pretty out of the blue, but there's something about Mario Music that makes it so unique. Mario Music is fun and
						playful, but also often extremely fast. I often use the music to get work done faster, but also while I paint since its fast and playful tempo
						makes it very addicting.

		<h1>Correlation Between Music and Visual Arts</h1>
			<p>
				Believe it or not, music and visual arts have a very close relationship - they are both forms of art anyways. Music affects our subconscious mind, and 
				depending on what you listen to, it can greatly impact the outcome of your painting. It has a strong effect on mark-making and colour choices that refect
				your mood. If you decide to listen to fast music (ex: Mario Kart music), it will naturall incite fast mark-making. This has been proven by many musicians, 
				psychologists and artists. In that sense, not only should you listen to music while drawing just to avoid boredom, but also enhance your art productivity 
				and generate more defined decisions. To learn more, click
