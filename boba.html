		<h2>Step 1</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/boba_drawing1.jpg" class="process_image" alt = "Boba Drawing 1">
				</div>
				<p>
					Begin a sketch of your drawing, first drawing the cup and the smaller elements and details within it. Unlike the previous tutorial, we'll keep
					the outlines to give it a more cartoon effect. You can use the pastel brush to create an even rougher sketch, but go over it again with the basic brush
					with a new layer as well.
				</p>
			</div>

			<br>
			
		<h2>Step 2</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/boba_drawing2.png" class="process_image"  alt = "Bunny Cake 2">
				</div>
				<p>
					You can begin colouring within the black outlines now - try to make several layers (using the layer feature) so you can easily correct your 
					mistakes later on if you notice them, and don't end up accidentally erasing other parts. You don't have to go too detailed during this process, 
					just get the foreground down. Use a thicker brush and the bucket tool to save time when adding colour.
				</p>
			</div>

		<h2>Step 3</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<img src="images/boba_drawingfinal.png" class="process_image"  alt = "Bunny Cake 3">
				</div>
				<p>
					Highlights and details are best part. Create a new layer directly on top of all previous ones, and using a thin brush to go over smaller details, 
					such as the drawing on the tape or the seeds on the strawberries. Once you have all the colour completed, use a white brush to add strokes that
					demonstrate reflecting light on the straw and strawberries.
