		<h1>History Of Art</h1>
			<p>
				Art has been around for thousands and thousands of years. Creating by
				humans, we focus on art for spiritual, narrative, philosophical, symbolic,
				conceptual, documentary, decorating, functional, and many, many other
				purposes. Visual art has progressed significantly through its aesthetic
				form. Forms of art include:

			<h2>Timeline</h2>
			<h3>Ancient Art</h3>
			  <p>
				Ancient art refers to the many arts produced by old, advanced cultures
				and has created the foundation of art.
			  </p>
			<h3>Renaissance</h3>
			  <p>
				The Renaissance was a period in European history making the transition
				from the Middle Ages to modernity. Through this period, art has been
				used to help revive and surpass ideas and achievements of classical
				antiquity.
			  </p>
			<h3>Baroque</h3>
			  <p>
				Baroque art consists of visual design and architecture during the era in
				the history of Western art that coincides with the 17th century. Baroque
				art is stylistically complex and evokes emotional states by appealing
				dramatically to human senses.
			  </p>
			<h3>Impressionism</h3>
			  <p>
				Impressionism was an art movement that consisted of small, thin, brush
				strokes to depict unusual visual angles and a moment, especially in
				terms of shifting the effect of light and colour.
			  </p>
			<h3>Post-Impressionism</h3>
			  <p>
				Post-Impressionism was, obviously, after the Impressionism era. This
				movement applied the reaction against the naturalistic depiction of
				light and colour in Impressionism. It contained more symbolic, formala
				and structural content.
			  </p>
			<h3>Expressionism</h3>
			  <p>
				Expressionism refers to the art movement where the image of reality is
				distorted to enhance the artist's intentions and feelings. Artists were
				able to express their subjective emotions and ideas with artistic style.
			  </p>
			<h3>Cubism</h3>
			  <p>
				Cubism was a revolutionary art movement that incorporated different
				views of subjects into the same picture. Cubism is notably different
				from after arts because of the large use of geometric shapes and their
				depth.
			  </p>
			<h3>Dada</h3>
			  <p>
				Dada art was a turning point in art history. Starting from the WW1,
				these art pieces incorporated the negative reaction and harrors and
				folly of the war. Dada art was quite silly, irrational and absurd.
			  </p>
			<h3>Pop-Art</h3>
			  <p>
				Pop-art was heavily influenced by modernized, popular, mass culture in
				the 1950's. This included advertising, comic books, and mundane
				mass-produced objects.
			  </p>
			<h3>Op-Art</h3>
			  <p>
				Op-art, short for optical art, included many illusions, making art
				incredibly interesting to look at. They often incorporated art to give
				the viewer impressions of movement, hidden images, flashing and
				vibrating patterns, or swelling or warping.
			  </p>
			<br>
			  <p>
				The birth of modern art traces back to the Industrial Revolution. The
				rapid evolution of manufacturing, transportation, and technology began
				around the mid-18th century, affecting society's take at social,
				economic, and cultural conditions in life. Artists around this time
				began to experiment with new ways of seeing, and used fresh ideas about
				the nature of materials and functions of art.

			<!--What digital art is-->
			<h2>Digital Art</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p>
				  Digital art can be computer generated, scanned, or drawn using tables or a
				  mouse. Ever since the 1990s, digital art became available after it was
				  possible to download videos onto computers. People have been so used to
				  creating art by pen and paint for centuries, so this was a real turning
				  point for artists. They had the creative freedom that they never
				  experienced before.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
				  Digital art is still something I'm fairly new to, but so far it's been
				  pretty fun. In some aspects, art is a lot easier, but there are a lot of
				  new features that I'm new to and I haven't quite understood yet. However,
				  I think it's one of my favourite forms of art yet. Here in the following
				  pictures, I have fairly simple designs - a "sticker sheet", bunny cake,
				  and a person holding a book.

			<!--What sketching is-->
			<h2>Sketching</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p>
				  Sketching is traditionally a rough drawing or painting in which artists use
				  to note down their preliminary ideas. They require little to no precision,
				  and are fairly quick. Sketches are used like a blueprint to portray the
				  overall feeling and composition of a final piece.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
				  Sketching is my favourite form of art - it's simple and fun. Sketching is
				  a rough drawing, normally used for artists to note" down their ideas on
				  paper. It can sometimes be messy and rough, but I often like the quick
				  look of it. Sketches are usually less detailed than a study, but it's
				  a great way for artists to visualize what they want to create.

			<!--What painting is-->
			<h2>Paint</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p>
				  Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color, or other
				  mediums on a matrix or canvas. Through paint, you can create a variety of
				  textures and tones to add depth to your creations. The birth of painting
				  dates back to over 42,000 years ago and has been widely used with a
				  variety of materials.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
				  Whenever I pull out my canvas and my paints, I always underestimate how
				  hard paint really is. I think I'm the least experienced when it comes to
				  paint. I always find myself struggling to get the right precision and
				  texture. I only paint when I have absolutely nothing else to do, since
				  it's a slight hassle to pull out the many materials - and easel, the
				  canvas, the paints, paint brushes, paint palettes, your water cup, and a
				  a lot of paper. Despite the hard effort, it's often pretty therapeutic. I
				  generally aim for more simplistic, cartoon designs so they can be easily
				  hung up in my room.
